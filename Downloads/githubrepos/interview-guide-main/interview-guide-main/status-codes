502 (bad gateway)

The proxy (Ingress/ALB/NLB/etc.) **couldn't get a valid response** from the app **even though the pod was running**.
Common Causes:
App is **overloaded** and **refuses connections** (e.g., too many open sockets or busy threads).
**Timeouts** — app is too slow to respond.
**Connection reset** or **refused** errors from the backend.
**Protocol mismatch** (e.g., Ingress using HTTP to talk to HTTPS backend).
**Kubernetes Clues:**
Pod is **Running and Ready**, but response is slow or rejected.
Logs might show `connection refused`, `timeout`, or unhandled exceptions.

503 Service Unavailable
There’s **no healthy pod** available to serve the request — the service cannot find a ready endpoint.
Common Causes:
App **crashed**, **not ready**, or stuck in **CrashLoopBackOff**.
**Readiness probe failures** — pod is running but not marked as ready.
No pods are backing the service (i.e., `kubectl get endpoints <svc>` returns none).
**Kubernetes Clues:**
Pod may be `CrashLoopBackOff`, `Pending`, or `Running` but not `Ready`.
Service has **0 endpoints**.
