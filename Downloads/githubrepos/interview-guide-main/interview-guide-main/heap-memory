Heap memory issues in Java-based microservices are common and can lead to degraded performance, application crashes, or OutOfMemoryErrors. Here's a breakdown of what they are, how they occur, and how to handle them:
---
### 1. What Is Heap Memory?
Heap memory is where Java stores objects created at runtime. It's managed by the **Garbage Collector (GC)**. The heap is divided into:
* **Young Generation** (Eden + Survivor spaces): For short-lived objects.
* **Old Generation**: For long-lived objects.
* **Metaspace**: For class metadata (since Java 8, moved from PermGen).
---
### 2. Common Heap Memory Issues
#### a. **Memory Leaks**
Objects that are no longer needed but are still referenced (e.g., via static maps, caches) stay in memory indefinitely.
**Symptoms:** Gradual memory usage increase, frequent full GCs, eventual `OutOfMemoryError`.
#### b. **OutOfMemoryError**
Thrown when the JVM cannot allocate memory for new objects because the heap is full.
Types:
* `java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space`
* `java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: GC overhead limit exceeded`
* `java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Metaspace`
#### c. Excessive Garbage Collection (GC)
When GC runs too frequently or takes too long, the app pauses often, leading to high latency.
**Symptoms:** High CPU usage, GC logs show frequent full GCs.
---
### **3. Causes in Microservices**
* **High object churn** (rapid creation/destruction of objects)
* **Large in-memory caches**
* **Improper object pooling**
* **Unbounded collections (e.g., queues, maps)**
* **Memory leaks due to third-party libraries**
---
### **4. Diagnosing Heap Issues**
* **JVM Logs**: Enable GC logs (`-Xlog:gc*` in Java 11+).
* **Heap Dumps**: Capture with `jmap` or `-XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError`.
* **Profilers**: VisualVM, YourKit, JProfiler.
* **Monitoring**: Tools like Prometheus + Grafana, ELK Stack, or AWS CloudWatch.
---
### **5. Mitigation & Best Practices**
* **Set appropriate JVM heap size**: e.g., `-Xms512m -Xmx2g`
* **Use efficient data structures**
* **Avoid unbounded caching** (use eviction policies)
* **Release references** to unused objects
* **Use tools like Eclipse MAT** to analyze heap dumps
* **Monitor and scale microservices horizontally** if needed
